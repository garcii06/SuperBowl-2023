Hello everyone, this is a small project using R to forecast the viewership in millions for the next Super Bowl.   
As many people know, forecasting is beneficial to any business, if you can forecast the total audience for an event like the Super Bowl, then you can decide 
if it is worth to publish an ad. 📈📉

## Summary
Here are the point estimates for each model, we can see that the `simple linear` model give the most optimistic forecast.😃
While the `Linear Piecewise` the pessimistic forecast.😰  
The other models give a in between.
| Model                 | Prediction (millions) |
| -------------         | -------------         |
| Simple Linear         | 116                   |
| Linear Piecewise      | 90.3                  |
| Exponential Smoothing | 102                   |
| 3 Moving Averages     | 102                   |
